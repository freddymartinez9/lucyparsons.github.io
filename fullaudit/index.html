      <h1>The Narcotics Audit</h1>
	<h2>Five Years and Counting...</h2>
<br>
	<p>Over the last year and a half the Lucy Parsons Labs has obtained approximately six hundred checks related to the Chicago Police Department's use of civil asset forfiture. This webpage is a searchable and sortable repository of all the checks we've obtained since 2009. There are links to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, a PDF result of the response, and the check amounts. We also invite you to read our full investitaion into CPD's use of civil asset forfiture in the <a href="link to article">Chicago Reader</a>. </p> 
<p>Our investigation found that the majority of the civil asset forfiture funds (or the 1505 fund) went to pay for the every day policing of the War on Drugs. Just as disturbing, a large portion of the surveillance equipment purchased by Chicago Police was with the use of 1505 fund. This includes controversial equipment such as IMSI catcher (commonly known as Stingrays), Automatic License Plate Readers, "blue light cameras" (or PODs) or PenLINK equipment. You can find the surveillance equipment by sorting the categories tab. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This is a live document. There are unknowns in the data set, due to liberal use of redactions by the Chicago Police's FOIA Department as well as unfulfilled requests. If you would like to FOIA for missing checks, find checks which have a missing requester name and send an email to <i>info AT lucyparsonslabs DOT com</i>. This audit began using records from 2009 to the present but it is our hope to continue this project into the future.</p>
