Lucy Parsons Labs was founded by technologists and scientists who believe in free expression, security, privacy, creativity, and access to knowledge. We live and work with these guiding principles in our lives each and every day, in both our personal and professional roles. We are serious about them.

Today we make public our commitment to those principles as Lucy Parsons Labs signed on to the Electronic Frontier Alliance. The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) is an organization we respect and admire for their decades of dedicated fighting to protect our digital and AFK (away from keyboard) world. We stand in solidarity with the EFF and anyone who will uphold these principles by fighting for transparency and freedom in culture, code, and law.       

Join us and many others in the fight!
